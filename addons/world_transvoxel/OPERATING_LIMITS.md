# World Transvoxel 1.0.14-dev Operating Limits

## Qualified release matrix

The 1.0.14-dev development build inherits the 1.0.9 Windows x86-64
qualification matrix, includes the documented 1.0.10-dev batched authoritative
sample query, makes native render transition fading opt-in/default-off, makes
fade shader instance-parameter writes opt-in/default-off, and adds the
endpoint-regularized mesh extraction boundary documented below. It is
qualified only for:

| Component | Supported value |
| --- | --- |
| Operating system | Windows 10/11 x86-64 |
| Godot | 4.6.3 and 4.7 |
| Runtime builds | `template_debug` and `template_release` |
| Renderer used by headless qualification | Compatibility |
| Native toolchain used to build release | Zig 0.16.0 |
| godot-cpp revision | `e83fd0904c13356ed1d4c3d09f8bb9132bdc6b77` |
| Terrain backend | official Transvoxel MIT backend |

Other platforms, architectures, and Godot versions are not qualified by this
release even if the source can be compiled for them.

## Mesh finalizer and topology boundary

- Mesh extraction regularizes the isosurface interpolation fraction to
  `[1/32, 31/32]` before canonical chunk positioning and normal interpolation.
  This prevents closed edited SDF surfaces from generating near-grid-sample
  sliver triangles that are topologically valid but visually unstable in carved
  terrain.
- The finalizer builds its edge-connectivity graph from quantized position keys
  at 1/1024 world-unit precision. This is a connectivity/orientation key only;
  it does not snap exported vertex positions.
- The M2 mesh topology hash is `02f60fe4c93375f9`.
- Matched interior or chunk-face connector slivers are no longer an accepted
  endpoint artifact for edited terrain. If a marker reports open-gap-free mesh
  quality warnings, it must be promoted into a targeted gate and resolved or
  explicitly scoped to a nonstandard profile.
- Topology probes must still report `boundary_edges=0`,
  `interior_boundary_edges=0`, `unknown_boundary_edges=0`,
  `nonmanifold_edges=0`, `orientation_conflict_edges=0`,
  `repeated_point_key_triangles=0`, `zero_area_unknown_triangles=0`, and
  `zero_edge_triangles=0`.
- Unknown zero-area triangles, repeated-point-key triangles, zero-edge
  triangles, interior/unknown boundary edges, nonmanifold edges, and orientation
  conflicts are hard failures.
- Do not delete matched connector slivers as a generic cleanup step. That was
  tested and opened real cracks in edited terrain. Endpoint regularization is
  the accepted fix for the reproduced closed-surface sliver case because it
  keeps neighboring chunks deterministic instead of removing surface triangles.
- Double-sided terrain, duplicate backstop geometry, and full-map/backdrop
  presentation layers are not part of this topology claim. They may hide visual
  symptoms but do not prove mesh correctness.

## Runtime configuration

| Property | Default | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| active chunks | 256 | 65,536 |
| viewers | 8 | 1,024 |
| demands per viewer | 4,096 | 65,536 |
| LOD refinement radius cap | 0, use viewer radius | 65,536 |
| total configured demands | derived | 65,536 |
| storage requests/completions | 256 each | 65,536 each |
| encoded page cache | 256 / 64 MiB | 65,536 / 1 GiB |
| decoded page cache | 128 / 64 MiB | 65,536 / 1 GiB |
| mesh cache | 128 / 128 MiB | 65,536 / 1 GiB |
| render cache | 128 / 128 MiB | 65,536 / 1 GiB |
| collision cache | 64 / 64 MiB | 65,536 / 1 GiB |
| trace events | 65,536 | 262,144 |
| render apply budget per frame | 4 | 128 |
| collision apply budget per frame | 2 | 128 |
| ready chunk retirement removals per frame | 4 | fixed in 1.0.4 |
| render transition fade duration | 0 frames, disabled | 240 |
| same-key render mesh replacement | direct swap by default | crossfade when transition frames > 0 |
| shader fade opacity parameter | `wt_fade_opacity`, opt-in/default-off | fixed in 1.0.11-dev |
| collision activation/deactivation | 96 / 128 | finite, nonnegative |

Viewer capacity multiplied by demand capacity per viewer may not exceed
65,536. `lod_refinement_radius_chunks=0` means no cap; nonzero values must not
exceed demand capacity per viewer. Deactivation distance must be at least
activation distance.

The native terrain `_process` path treats `collision_apply_budget` as the total
per-frame collision application budget. Immediate safety applications performed
while draining collision publications consume that same budget instead of
creating an extra collision-shape replacement pass later in the frame.

## Streaming and edited-LOD continuity

The authoritative edited-terrain LOD rule lives in the core repository at
`world-transvoxel/docs/contracts/PRODUCTION_EDITED_TERRAIN_LOD_CORRECTNESS_CONTRACT.md`.
This section records the practical runtime limits carried by this integration
game copy.

- Moving-viewer terrain is streamed from an active desired chunk set. Projects
  should expect coarse far terrain plus detailed chunks around active viewers,
  not every LOD0 chunk of a large world resident at once.
- Runtime mesh watertightness and streaming visual continuity are separate
  claims. A mesh probe with zero interior boundary/nonmanifold edges does not by
  itself prove that every possible camera path is free from transient loading or
  LOD-popping artifacts.
- Recent edit LOD-retention zones are promoted into temporary planner viewers so
  recently dug or placed terrain remains detailed when the player moves away and
  returns. The current implementation remembers up to 256 edit-retention zones,
  keeps the newest 32 zones active even without a real viewer nearby, merges
  zones within 64 m, uses one LOD0 root-radius chunk, and clamps edit refinement
  to one through six LOD0 chunks. When the full retention plan exceeds capacity,
  runtime planning degrades retention by keeping the newest/visible zones first
  and reducing retention refinement before dropping retention entirely.
- Multi-site edit retention is capacity-sensitive. The compact 2K profile with
  two distant edited sites is qualified with active/render/collision capacities
  of 2048. A 1024 active-chunk cap was observed to trigger retention fallback
  under two-site digging and could produce distance-dependent edited-hole
  simplification or disappearance.
- Render transition fading is opt-in and disabled by default. Enabling
  `render_transition_frames` is a presentation choice; it must not be used as a
  substitute for missing geometry or as proof that terrain is seamless.
- Projects that need aggressive high-speed flight must qualify the chosen
  viewer radius, active chunk capacity, viewer update distance, render/collision
  apply budgets, and storage/meshing throughput together. Raising one value in
  isolation can increase churn instead of improving visible continuity.

## Geometry and world bounds

- Chunk cells per axis: 16.
- Stored samples per axis: 19, including fixed negative/positive padding.
- Maximum LOD: 20.
- Regular chunk: 49,152 vertices and 61,440 indices maximum.
- Each transition face: 3,072 vertices and 9,216 indices maximum.
- One chunk may own up to six transition faces.
- World manifest: 262,144 pages maximum.
- Compact procedural world descriptor: 262,144 indexed hierarchy pages maximum.
  The current deterministic source emits LOD0..LOD3 pages with eight LOD0,
  four LOD1, two LOD2, and one LOD3 vertical layers for the configured chunk
  slice.
- Manifest dependency records: 1,024 maximum; dependency text is 255 bytes.

## Storage, editing, and operations

- Common container size: 256 MiB maximum.
- Container section: 64 MiB maximum; 4,096 sections maximum.
- Production edit journal: 4,096 transactions, 65,536 commands, and 64 MiB.
- One edit transaction: 4,096 commands maximum.
- Runtime world-operation queue: 16 requests.
- Edit operations are foreground operations in the world-operation queue. They
  preserve relative edit order but are processed ahead of non-edit
  sample/snapshot requests already waiting in the queue.
- Accepted edit replacement sampling and meshing use the highest scheduler
  priority. A running chunk job is allowed to finish, then the runtime yields
  the remaining streaming batch when another edit is waiting.
- Projects must not depend on collision-only player targeting. Collision can lag
  visible terrain during fast viewer movement; gameplay layers need a bounded
  fallback target path or an explicit rejection reason before reporting an edit
  as attempted.
- One authoritative sample batch query: 4,096 grid points maximum.
- Side-by-side snapshot compaction: 4,096 pages and 256 MiB of source page
  bytes maximum.
- Storage CLI input: 1 GiB maximum, while common containers retain the
  stricter 256 MiB limit.
- Dense bake input is file-backed: finite-density validation uses a fixed
  1 MiB buffer, source sampling uses a 192 KiB explicit block cache, and one
  encoded page payload is retained at a time.
- Bake key and manifest metadata still scale with requested pages and remain
  bounded by the 262,144-page world-manifest limit.
- Schema-1 storage codec is `none`; compressed storage is not supported.

Compaction and migration never overwrite the live world. The output directory
must not exist, is published atomically after completion, and must be reopened
through a controlled stop/start before it becomes active.

## Operational requirements

- Runtime access is event-driven. Applications must send viewer updates when
  position or demand changes; there is no implicit scene viewer discovery.
- Keep viewer revisions monotonic and remove viewers when no longer active.
- Polling readiness is allowed, but signals and event-driven application code
  are preferred.
- Moving-viewer plan changes retain retiring render/collision chunks until the
  current replacement set is fully ready. During sustained movement, resource
  and application-record ownership can temporarily approach twice the active
  chunk capacity; it returns to the current desired set after streaming settles.
  Runtime metrics expose both `pending_chunk_retirements` and
  `pending_chunk_replacements`; both must be zero before a profile claims
  settled visual readiness. Render transition fading is disabled by default:
  same-key render mesh replacements swap directly, so terrain edits do not
  create a white blink/fade. Projects that explicitly set
  `WorldTransvoxelConfig.render_transition_frames` above zero opt into temporary
  retiring render instances, retirement fade-out, and introduction fade-in for
  that many frames. Custom terrain shaders that want deterministic native fade
  behavior through `ALPHA` must declare an instance uniform named
  `wt_fade_opacity` with default `1.0`, apply it to `ALPHA`, set a positive
  render transition frame count, and explicitly enable
  `WorldTransvoxelConfig.shader_fade_parameter_enabled`. This switch is off by
  default because Godot retains per-instance shader-parameter slots after use;
  stable large-scale scenes must keep the default unless the project has a
  measured shader-slot budget. Collision is removed at retirement.
- Authoritative sample queries can fail for absent, corrupt, misaligned, or
  disagreeing overlapping pages.
- Output paths for bake, migration, and compaction must not already exist.
- Python 3.11 or newer is required only for packaged command-line/editor tools,
  not for runtime terrain use.
